## Overview

Kintsugi offers an industry-leading tier with rate limiting. All API-enabled accounts can have a maximum of 10,000 requests/minute.

## Rate Limits

- **Standard API endpoints**: 10,000 requests per minute


## Rate Limiting Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="General REST API Best Practices">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
        When you receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response, wait before retrying. Start with 1 second, then double the wait time for each subsequent retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use Request Batching">
        Combine multiple operations into single API calls when possible to reduce the total number of requests.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Monitor Your Usage">
        Track your API usage patterns and implement alerts when approaching rate limits to avoid service interruptions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Cache Responses">
        Store API responses locally and only make new requests when data has actually changed.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Accordion title="Kintsugi Tax API Specific Guidelines">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Nexus State Optimization" icon="map-pin">
        Only call `/v1/tax/estimate` for transactions in states where you have nexus. This reduces unnecessary API calls and improves performance.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Smart Caching" icon="database">
        Cache tax calculation results when transaction details haven't changed. Use transaction hashes or timestamps to determine if recalculation is needed.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Avoid Duplicates" icon="copy">
        Implement deduplication logic to prevent multiple identical API calls for the same transaction within a short time window.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Batch Processing" icon="long-arrow-right">
        Process multiple transactions in batches during off-peak hours to stay within rate limits during high-traffic periods.
      </Card>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling & Recovery">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="HTTP 429 Response">
        ```json
        {
          "error": "Too Many Requests",
          "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 60 seconds.",
          "retry_after": 60
        }
        ```
        
        **Action**: Wait for the specified `retry_after` seconds before making another request.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Retry Logic Example">
        ```python
        import time
        import requests
        
        def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
            for attempt in range(max_retries):
                response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
                
                if response.status_code == 429:
                    retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
                    time.sleep(retry_after)
                    continue
                    
                return response
                
            raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization Tips">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Pre-calculate Common Scenarios">
        Calculate tax for common product categories and shipping scenarios in advance, then use lookup tables for frequently occurring transactions (i.e., recurring subscription products to repeat customers).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Implement Circuit Breakers">
        Temporarily stop making API calls if you're consistently hitting rate limits, allowing the system to recover.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use Async Processing">
        Process non-critical tax calculations asynchronously to avoid blocking your main application flow.
      </Step>
