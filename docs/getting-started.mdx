Kintsugi AI is a leading sales tax solution that automates sales tax compliance for all kinds of businesses. It covers end-to-end sales tax compliance for your business, including nexus determination, tax calculations, registrations, filings, and much more. To get started with using Kintsugi, please follow the below steps:

## Complete the onboarding

1. We recommend integration with your existing system by clicking on '**Connect**' in the '**Data Sources**' section on the left-hand panel. If you have historical transactions in CSV files, you can import them using the File Upload functionality.
2. Specify the jurisdictions where you have a physical presence due to an office, remote employees, inventory, etc.
3. Add your organization's details so that we have all the information to get you registered and filed in jurisdictions where you meet nexus.
4. Add your bank details that can be used to remit the sales tax for you.
5. Approve your products so that we can apply accurate sales tax rates to your transactions. If you have many products, you can use 'Kintsugi Intelligence' to automatically classify them. You can also use the bulk approve functionality to approve all the products on the page at once.
6. Ensure that you do not have any invalid addresses. You can check that in the 'Tasks' section on the dashboard.
7. Add addresses to the transactions where the addresses are missing. If you have many blank addresses, you can use 'Kintsugi Intelligence' to automatically add addresses. You can check the transactions with blank addresses in the 'Tasks' section on the dashboard.
8. Check your Nexus exposure by navigating to the 'Nexus' section on the left-hand panel. You can also check the exposure map on the dashboard.
9. Manage your exemptions so that only the relevant transactions are taxed. You can do so by navigating to the 'Exemptions' section on the left-hand panel.
