## Why Get Certified?

### For Partners

- ✅ Clear expectations and guidance throughout implementation
- ✅ Validation that your integration works correctly
- ✅ "Kintsugi Certified" badge for marketing materials
- ✅ Reduced support burden and faster issue resolution
- ✅ Priority support from Solutions Engineering team

### For Mutual Customers

- ✅ Confidence in integration quality
- ✅ Consistent, reliable tax calculations
- ✅ Fewer integration-related issues

## What Certification Means

Being **Kintsugi Certified** means your integration has passed our validation and is ready for production:

- ✅ Tax calculations are accurate across all supported jurisdictions
- ✅ Transaction syncing works reliably for orders, refunds, and lifecycle events
- ✅ Error handling gracefully manages edge cases and API responses
- ✅ Address validation provides clear, actionable feedback to users

Certification is **binary**: you're either Kintsugi Certified or not. No tiers, no levels—just a clear validation that your integration meets our quality standards.

## How It Works

1. **Review Integration Checklist** - Clear requirements for your integration type
2. **Build to API Specifications** - Follow our developer documentation
3. **Validation Testing** - We test your integration together
4. **Receive Certification** - Get your badge and go live

**Typical Timeline:** 2-4 weeks depending on platform complexity

## Who Should Get Certified?

All technology partners building integrations with Kintsugi should pursue certification:

- E-commerce platforms
- ERP and accounting software
- Billing and subscription platforms
- Order management systems
- Inventory management systems
- Custom integrations

## Integration Patterns

### L1: Kintsugi-Built Integrations

- Kintsugi builds and maintains the integration
- No certification required (we validate our own work)
- Examples: Native integrations with major platforms

### L2: Partner-Built Integrations

- Partner builds the integration using our API
- **Certification required**
- We provide guidance and validate functionality

### Hybrid: L1 Base + L2 Extensions

- Kintsugi builds core integration (L1)
- Partner extends with additional features (L2)
- **Certification required for L2 components only**

## Support Throughout the Process
