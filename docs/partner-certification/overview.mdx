<Note>
**What is Partner Certification?** Kintsugi's Partner Certification program validates that your integration correctly handles tax calculations, transaction syncing, and error scenarios. It's our way of ensuring quality partnerships and reducing support burden—not a barrier to entry.
</Note>

The Kintsugi Partner Certification program validates integrations built by partners using the Kintsugi API. When you're building a tax integration for your platform, certification ensures you're handling all the critical capabilities correctly—before your customers encounter issues.

## What Certification Means

Being **Kintsugi Certified** means:

✅ Your integration correctly calculates tax across all jurisdictions we support <br/>
✅ Transaction syncing works reliably for orders and refunds <br/>
✅ Error handling gracefully manages edge cases and API changes <br/>
✅ Address validation provides clear, actionable feedback <br/>
✅ Your integration is ready for production use <br/>

Certification is **binary**: you're either Kintsugi Certified or not. There are no tiers or levels for technical certification: just a clear validation that your integration meets our quality standards.

## Why Get Certified?

Certification benefits both you and your customers:

**For You:**
- Catch issues before your customers do
- Reduce support tickets and troubleshooting time
- Get listed on Kintsugi's partner directory
- Receive certification badge and go-to-market support

**For Your Customers:**
- Confidence that tax calculations are accurate
- Reliable transaction tracking for compliance
- Better error messages when issues occur

## Integration Patterns

Kintsugi supports two integration patterns:

### Level 1: Transaction Syncing

Transaction syncing enables reporting and filing. A Level 1 integration and everything it encompasses is required before a Level 2 integration can be built.

### Level 2: Sales Tax Calculation Support

A Level 2 integration utilizes Kintsugi's sales tax engine via our API's for real-time calculations.

<Note>
**Certification applies to Level 2 components**: If Kintsugi builds Level 1 features, we handle validation for those. Certification focuses on what your team builds.
</Note>

## What Gets Validated

Certification validates three core capabilities. See the <a href="/docs/partner-certification/checklist" target="_blank">Certification Checklist</a> for more details.

### 2. Transaction Syncing

We verify reliable transaction data syncing:
- Orders sync successfully to Kintsugi
- Refunds sync correctly (credit notes)
- Data integrity (amounts, item details, customer info)
- Additional transaction types based on your platform

### 2. Tax Calculations

The most critical capability. We verify:
- Tax calculation accuracy for standard transactions
- Proper parameter handling (address, items, amounts)
- Correct rate application across jurisdictions
- Fallback scenarios (state + zip, zip-only)

### 3. Error Handling

We verify graceful error management:
- Address errors provide specific, actionable messages
- API error handling manages rate limits and retries
- Your integration handles API response changes
