## Why Get Certified?

### For Partners

- ✅ Clear expectations and guidance throughout implementation
- ✅ Validation that your integration works correctly
- ✅ "Kintsugi Certified" badge for marketing materials
- ✅ Reduced support burden and faster issue resolution
- ✅ Priority support from Solutions Engineering team

### For Mutual Customers

- ✅ Confidence in integration quality
- ✅ Consistent, reliable tax calculations
- ✅ Fewer integration-related issues

## What Certification Means

Being **Kintsugi Certified** means your integration has passed our validation and is ready for production:

- ✅ Tax calculations are accurate across all supported jurisdictions
- ✅ Transaction syncing works reliably for orders, refunds, and lifecycle events
- ✅ Error handling gracefully manages edge cases and API responses
- ✅ Address validation provides clear, actionable feedback to users

Certification is **binary**: you're either Kintsugi Certified or not. No tiers, no levels—just a clear validation that your integration meets our quality standards.

## How It Works

1. **Review Integration Checklist** - Clear requirements for your integration type
2. **Build to API Specifications** - Follow our developer documentation
3. **Validation Testing** - We test your integration together
4. **Receive Certification** - Get your badge and go live

**Typical Timeline:** 2-4 weeks depending on platform complexity

## Who Should Get Certified?

All technology partners building integrations with Kintsugi should pursue certification:

- E-commerce platforms
- ERP and accounting software
- Billing and subscription platforms
- Order management systems
- Inventory management systems
- Custom integrations

## Integration Patterns

Kintsugi uses a two-level integration model. **Level 1 (L1)** is transaction sync—the foundation. **Level 2 (L2)** adds the tax engine (real-time tax calculation at checkout). L1 must be in place before L2 can be enabled.

Kintsugi may build the transaction sync (L1) aspect of the integration for you. In those cases, you would only need to build the L2 tax calculation flow. In other cases, partners build the integration end-to-end.

### L1: Transaction Sync (Level 1)

- Kintsugi or Partner builds and maintains the **transaction sync** integration
- Syncs completed transactions for compliance tracking and nexus determination
- **Certification required** if partner-built
- We provide guidance and validate functionality if partner-built

### L2: Tax Engine (Level 2)

- Partner builds and maintains the **tax estimate** integration (or enables it on an existing L1 connection)
- Adds real-time tax calculation during checkout; transaction sync (L1) continues for compliance
- **Certification required**
- We provide guidance and validate functionality

### Hybrid: L1 Base + L2 Extensions

- Kintsugi or Partner builds core integration (L1)
- Partner extends with additional features (L2)
- **Certification required for partner-built components**
