title: "Partner Certification Checklist"
description: "Capability-based requirements for building a quality integration with Kintsugi"
---

## Overview

This checklist guides you through building a quality integration with Kintsugi. **Not all items apply to every integration** - your Solutions Engineering contact will help you identify which requirements are relevant for your platform.

Integration capabilities align with Kintsugi's [L1/L2 model](/docs/api-guides/planning-an-integration): **L1** (Transaction Syncing) is the foundation; **L2** adds the tax engine (Tax Calculations). Requirements depend on which level you build.
