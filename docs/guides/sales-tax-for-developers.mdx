description: "Master sales tax compliance for e-commerce and SaaS applications"
---

Building e-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, and marketplace solutions means navigating one of the most complex regulatory landscapes in software development: sales tax. Unlike federal income tax with consistent rules, sales tax operates across 50+ state and local jurisdictions, each with unique requirements, thresholds, and definitions.

<Note>
This guide covers the fundamental concepts every developer needs to build tax-compliant systems. For implementation details, see our [API Reference](/reference/api/tax-estimation/estimate-tax).
</Note>

## The Four-Factor Taxability Framework

Sales tax isn't a simple yes/no decision. Every transaction requires evaluating four interconnected factors:

```

</Expandable>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Nexus - The Business Connection">
    **Does your business have a connection to the state?**
    
    Without nexus, you have no tax collection obligation in that jurisdiction. Nexus comes in two forms:
    
    - **Physical nexus**: Offices, warehouses, employees, inventory storage
    - **Economic nexus**: Sales volume or transaction count thresholds
    
    <Tip>
    Remote employees create physical nexus in their state, even if they work from home.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Product Taxability - What's Actually Taxable">
    **Is your product or service taxable in that state?**
    
    Taxability varies wildly by state and product type:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Physical Goods">
        - **Always taxable**: Electronics, clothing, furniture
        - **Often exempt**: Groceries, prescription drugs, medical devices
        - **State-specific**: Clothing (exempt in PA, taxable in CA)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Digital Products">
        - **Taxable**: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii
        - **Exempt**: California, New York, Florida
        - **Mixed rules**: Software vs. digital services
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Services">
        - **Generally exempt**: Most states
        - **Always taxable**: Hawaii, New Mexico, South Dakota, West Virginia
        - **Selective**: Professional services, repair services
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Customer Exemptions - Who Gets Special Treatment">
    **Does the customer qualify for an exemption?**
    
    Common exempt customers:
    - Government agencies
    - Nonprofit organizations (501c3)
    - Businesses purchasing for resale
    - Educational institutions
    
    <Warning>
    Exempt sales require valid exemption certificates. Collecting tax on exempt sales creates audit liability.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Sourcing - Where to Apply the Rate">
    **Which location determines the tax rate?**
    
    Two sourcing methods exist:
    - **Origin-based**: Rate based on seller's location
    - **Destination-based**: Rate based on customer's location
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Nexus Types: Physical vs Economic

The 2018 Wayfair Supreme Court decision fundamentally changed sales tax obligations, creating two distinct nexus types:

    style K fill:#E8F0D9,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
```
</Expandable>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Physical Nexus" icon="building">
    **Traditional connection to a state**
    
    **Triggers:**
    - Retail stores or offices
    - Warehouses or inventory storage
    - Employees or contractors
    - Trade shows or pop-up shops
    
    **Timeline:** Immediate upon establishment
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Economic Nexus" icon="chart-line">
    **Sales volume-based connection**
    
    **Common Thresholds:**
    - $100,000 annual sales OR
    - 200 transactions per year
    
    **High-volume states:**
    - CA, NY, TX: $500,000
    - NY: $500,000 + 100 transactions
    
    **Timeline:** Register with effective nexus start date, start collection
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Sales by State">
    Track both revenue and transaction counts for each state where you sell.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Threshold Alerts">
    Configure notifications when approaching nexus thresholds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Before Collecting">
    Never collect tax without a valid permit—it's illegal in most states.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin Collection Immediately">
    Start collecting tax on the very next transaction after registration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sourcing Rules: Origin vs Destination

Once you have nexus and a taxable product, you need to determine which tax rate applies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Origin-Based Sourcing">
    **Tax rate based on seller's location**
    
    **States:** Arizona, California, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia
    
    **How it works:**
    - Austin, TX merchant charges Austin rate to all Texas customers
    - Same rate whether shipping to Dallas, Houston, or rural West Texas
    - Simplifies calculation but concentrates revenue in business locations
    
    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeGroupItem title="Example">
        ```javascript
        // Origin-based calculation
        const taxRate = getOriginRate(sellerLocation);
        const taxAmount = transactionAmount * taxRate;
        ```
      </CodeGroupItem>
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Destination-Based Sourcing">
    **Tax rate based on customer's delivery address**
    
    **How it works:**
    - Los Angeles merchant charges San Diego rate for San Diego delivery
    - Must calculate different rates for each delivery address
    - Navigate 11,000+ tax jurisdictions across the US
    
    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeGroupItem title="Example">
        ```javascript
        // Destination-based calculation
        const taxRate = getDestinationRate(customerAddress);
        const taxAmount = transactionAmount * taxRate;
        ```
      </CodeGroupItem>
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="California's Mixed Sourcing">
    **Hybrid approach with complex rules**
    
    - **State, county, city taxes**: Origin-based
    - **District taxes**: Destination-based
    - Creates exceptional complexity for developers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Marketplace Facilitators

E-commerce marketplaces have spawned specialized legislation that shifts compliance responsibility from sellers to platforms:

<Expandable title="🛒 Marketplace Facilitator Diagram" icon="store">
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Sale Occurs] --> B[Determine Marketplace Type]
    B --> C[Facilitator Platforms]
    C --> D[Amazon, eBay, Etsy]
    D --> E[Platform Handles Tax]
    E --> F[Seller Exempt from Registration]
    
    B --> G[Non-Facilitator Platforms]
    G --> H[Shopify, WooCommerce]
    H --> I[Seller Handles Tax]
    I --> J[Seller Must Handle Compliance]
    
    style A fill:#E8F0D9,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style B fill:#E5D1FA,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style C fill:#B0ED9C,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style D fill:#E5D1FA,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style E fill:#E5D1FA,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style F fill:#48c020,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
    style G fill:#ff2c2c,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
    style H fill:#E5D1FA,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000
    style I fill:#ed8936,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
    style J fill:#ff2c2c,stroke:#213331,stroke-width:2px,color:#FFFFFF
```
</Expandable>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Marketplace Facilitators" icon="store">
    **Platforms that handle tax collection**
    
    **Examples:**
    - Amazon (FBA sellers)
    - eBay, Etsy
    - Walmart Marketplace
    - TikTok Shops
    
    **Responsibilities:**
    - Collect and remit sales tax
    - Act as "retailer of record"
    - Handle all tax compliance
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Non-Facilitator Platforms" icon="code">
    **Platforms where sellers handle their own tax**
    
    **Examples:**
    - Shopify, WooCommerce
    - Wix, Squarespace
    - Custom-built solutions
    
    **Responsibilities:**
    - Sellers must register and collect
    - Platform provides tools only
    - Full compliance burden on seller
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Key Distinction:** If you sell exclusively through facilitating platforms, you typically don't need separate state registrations—unless you have physical nexus or make direct sales outside the marketplace.
</Note>

## Collection Timeline

The timing of sales tax obligations follows a precise sequence that systems must automate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Home State Registration">
    Register before making your first sale. Most states require permits regardless of volume.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Physical Nexus Registration">
    Register within 30 days of establishing physical presence (office, employee, inventory).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Economic Nexus Monitoring">
    Track sales by state and register within 30 days of exceeding thresholds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin Collection">
    Start collecting tax immediately upon receiving your permit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Returns">
    File and remit taxes according to assigned frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually).
  </Step>
</Steps>
