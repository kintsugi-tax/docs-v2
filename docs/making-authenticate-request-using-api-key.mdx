title: "Making Authenticated Request"
description: "Describes how to use API Key and x-organization-id to make an authorized request."

<Note>
**Important**: Kintsugi uses API key authentication via headers, **not** bearer token authentication. You must include both the API key and organization ID in request headers.
</Note>

## Prerequisite

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Make sure you have an API key. Refer [Creating and managing API Keys](/docs/creating-and-managing-api-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Make sure you have your organization ID. You can find your Organization ID in the **lower left-hand corner** after logging into the [Kintsugi Platform](https://app.trykintsugi.com).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Making Requests

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Now that you have the API Key and Organization ID, you're ready to make authorized requests to the Kintsugi API.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **API Key Header**: Set your API key in the header with the key `x-api-key` (lowercase with hyphens):
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
       https://api.trykintsugi.com/v1/tax/estimate
  ```

  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Organization ID Header**: For most requests, you also need to set the organization ID in the header with the key `x-organization-id` (lowercase with hyphens):
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
       -H "x-organization-id: your-org-id" \
       https://api.trykintsugi.com/v1/tax/estimate
  ```

  </Step>

## Authentication Format

Kintsugi API uses **header-based API key authentication**, not bearer token authentication. Every request requires:

1. **`x-api-key`** header with your API key
2. **`x-organization-id`** header with your organization ID

Both headers are required for authentication. The organization ID ensures requests are scoped to the correct organization.

## Finding Your Organization ID

Your Organization ID can be found in the **lower left-hand corner** of the Kintsugi Platform dashboard after you log in. It's displayed as a unique identifier for your organization.
