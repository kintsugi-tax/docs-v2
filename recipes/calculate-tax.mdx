# Calculate Tax for a Transaction

## Overview

The Tax Estimation API calculates the estimated tax for a transaction based on your organization's nexus status, product taxability, customer exemptions, and shipping addresses. This endpoint is **idempotent** and doesn't create permanent transaction records, making it perfect for testing tax calculations during checkout flows.

## When to Use

- **Shopping cart pages**: Calculate tax when customers review their order
- **Checkout flows**: After address entry but before payment processing
- **Subscription billing**: Calculate tax for recurring charges
- **Quote generation**: Provide tax estimates to customers

## Authentication

This endpoint requires two headers:
- `x-api-key`: Your API key
- `x-organization-id`: Your organization ID

<Note>
Both headers are required for authentication. You can find your API key and organization ID in your [Kintsugi dashboard](https://app.trykintsugi.com).
</Note>

## Try It Out

Use the interactive playground below to test the tax estimation endpoint. The playground will automatically include the required authentication headers.

<Info>
The playground prefills example values from the API schema. Modify the request body to test different scenarios like different addresses, product types, or customer exemptions.
