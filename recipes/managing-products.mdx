# Create a Product

## Overview

Products in Kintsugi represent the items you sell. Each product needs proper tax classification (category and subcategory) to ensure accurate tax calculations. This endpoint creates a new product record that will be used for tax calculations in transactions.

## When to Use

- **Product catalog setup**: Create products when setting up your integration
- **New product launches**: Add new products as you expand your catalog
- **Tax classification**: Ensure products have proper tax categories for accurate calculations
- **Manual product management**: Create products outside of automated syncs

## Authentication

This endpoint requires two headers:
- `x-api-key`: Your API key
- `x-organization-id`: Your organization ID

<Note>
Both headers are required for authentication. You can find your API key and organization ID in your [Kintsugi dashboard](https://app.trykintsugi.com).
</Note>

## Try It Out

Use the interactive playground below to create a product. The playground will automatically include the required authentication headers.

<Info>
The playground prefills example values from the API schema. Modify the request body to test different product configurations. You'll need valid product categories and subcategories - see the [Get Product Categories](/reference/api/products/get-product-categories) endpoint for available options.
</Info>

## Required Fields

- `external_id`: Your internal product identifier (must be unique within your organization)
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_category`: Product category (see [Get Product Categories](/reference/api/products/get-product-categories))
- `product_subcategory`: Product subcategory (see [Get Product Categories](/reference/api/products/get-product-categories))

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Product Creation

Create a product with minimal required fields:

```json
{
  "external_id": "SKU-12345",
  "product_name": "Example Product",
  "product_category": "Physical",
  "product_subcategory": "General Physical"
}
```

### Product with Full Details

Include additional product information:

```json
{
  "external_id": "PROD-ABC-123",
  "product_name": "Premium Wireless Headphones",
  "product_category": "Physical",
  "product_subcategory": "General Physical",
  "product_description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation",
  "source": "API"
}
```

## Response Fields

The API returns detailed product information:

- `id`: Kintsugi's unique product identifier
- `external_id`: Your product identifier
- `product_name`: Product name
- `product_category`: Product category
- `product_subcategory`: Product subcategory
- `status`: Product status (ACTIVE, ARCHIVED)
- `source`: Source of the product record
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the product was created

## Product Categories

Before creating products, you may want to fetch available categories and subcategories using the [Get Product Categories](/reference/api/products/get-product-categories) endpoint. Categories determine how products are taxed across different jurisdictions.

<Info>
Product categories align with tax regulations across jurisdictions. Choose the most specific category and subcategory that matches your product to ensure accurate tax calculations.
